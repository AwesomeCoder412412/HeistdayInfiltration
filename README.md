## About

You, Jesse G. Goode are low on cash. And when I say low on cash, I mean
you quite literally sold most of your body on the black market. Your legs


(Just use your arms to excruciatingly drag your horrifying torso around!), a lung(You probably only need one to breath. Probably.),

heart(Your blood probably needs a rest from being pumped around so much anyways), and your entire torso and head(How... how are you alive). 

According to that hideous giant magical wombat you met at that children's park that you were selling black-market candy at,

there's a secret vault, way out in the desert, that holds some of the greatest treasures that mankind has ever had. 

And these things would sell for more money than moon rocks on the black market. But there's a catch- It's incredibly well guarded.

Lucky for you, the aforementioned magical wombat has a few tricks up his sleeve- and not all of them are rolled up balls of his disgusting body hair.

He gifts you a magical machine gun with an identity crisis on whether it wants to be a laser or a gun, an infinite army of mindless drones- sorry, 

I meant teammates who will go wherever you go and look(And who are also incredibly powerful), a escape helicopter piloted by Santa Claus wearing a fanny pack, 

and a TAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNKK from the sky realm. 
Be careful to get out of its way when it comes down from there. And did I mention an unlimited supply of grenades?

So cross your fingers, load your weapon, and get ready to be teleported into the crazy adventure of

## How to Play:
* Main Objective: One way or another, get the treasure, and get to the helicopter. Don't die.

* Side Objective: Try to rack up as many points as possible and beat your high score.

* Side Objective: Try to complete all the achievements(more coming soon).

* Side Objective: Ignore all the previous objectives and do whatever you want.

You can customize your game using the play menu, choosing how many guards, rooms, and teammates you want. Also TAAAAAAAAANK. There is a limit of 5 guards for now, later on there will be no limit, like teammates. (Hypothetically. Please don't break your computer trying to push the game to its limits. Or do. I don't mind.) You can choose the minimum and maximum amount of rooms you want, or just set them both to the same number if you want a specific amount of rooms.

You can change your keybinds in settings, (except WASD, space for jump, shift for run, and arrow keys. Will be implemented in the future.) and you can see more information on the controls.

The tank is yes. That's all I'm gonna say.
